## Features and Implementation

### Navigation

#### Navigation Button:
- Implemented using next/navigation's useRouter hook.
- Example:
```bash

"use client";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";

export default function Home() {
  const router = useRouter();

  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => router.push("/consultants")}
      className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded"
    >
      Go to Consultants
    </button>
  );
}

```

### Calendar Component

- Built using react-calendar.
- Unavailable dates are displayed in gray.
- Available dates are highlighted using conditional styling.

### Demo Data Integration

- A consultants.json file contains mock data.
- The data is fetched using fs for server-side fetching in Next.js:

```bash

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "about1": "Hello, I'm Swetha, a licensed therapist dedicated to guiding individuals through life's challenges with empathy and expertise.

#### 404 Page

- Implemented as not-found.tsx inside the app directory:

```bash
import React from "react";
import Link from "next/link";

function NotFound() {
  return (
    <div className="pt-40 min-h-screen flex flex-col items-center">
      <h2 className="text-[120px] font-[600] text-[#1F86D0] opacity-[24%]">
        404
      </h2>
      <h4 className="text-[44px] font-[500] text-[#1F86D0]">
        Oops! Page Not Found
      </h4>
      <p className="mt-3 w-1/4 text-[20px] font-[500] text-[#7F7F7F] text-center">
        It seems we can't find the page you're looking for, Let's get you back
        on track!
      </p>

      <div className="w-56 mt-10 flex justify-center">
        <Link
          href="/"
          className="w-full py-4 text-white bg-[#1F86D0] font-[600] text-[18px] rounded-[3rem] cursor-pointer"
        >
          Back to home
        </Link>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default NotFound;
```
